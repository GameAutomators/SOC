## Organization: Game Automators

# Introduction

Game Automators is an open source organization that is dedicated to building tools and engage student and practitioner communities to share new and innovative ways of using computer and mobile games in a fashion that complement with the university education.

Making learning fun is extremely important and such learning could prove to be a major motivator for a lot more students to take up STEM courses and careers in technology. Access to quality education is still a distant reality for a large section of the population, however with the increase in smart phone penetration, learning content is now available at their fingertips in the form of MOOCs and other open course ware. However, theory and practice applied together have proven to deliver higher learning retention rate and increased interest in the area. The aim of Game Automators is to apply the content in courses of machine learning, computer vision, electronics etc.., to automate the game play in mobile and desktop games.

# Game Automation Framework

Game Automators has been a major accomplishment in the last summer and resulted in the release of a book and teaching image processing and computer vision to students and then go ahead and automate their own games. How would it be if every person could just connect their phone to their computer and run the code through a framework that does this. The aim of the project is to build such a framework and enable remote non USB based automation and providing Android with the community to automate UI testing of Android.

### Required Skills
- Android development and Systems engineering skills.
- Experience with Web / Desktop applications with Python/C++.
- Experience with test automation tools and frameworks.
- Understanding of CI Systems and Build pipelines

## Features of Framework

1. Plugin a device into the laptop or desktop.
2. Enable the mobile screen view on the desktop.
3. Show a scratch like UI with custom blockly object blocks which convert into underlying python code to execute on the android device using the ADB/instruments debugger.
4. Play and record the entire automation or execute step by step executions like a Jupyter notebook.
5. Ability for users to create equivalents of Kernels as on Kaggle.
6. Wireless connections to mobile devices and device screens.
7. Cloud based mobile device for downloading an App image and testing.
