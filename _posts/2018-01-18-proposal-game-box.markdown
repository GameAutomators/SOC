## Organization: Game Automators

# Introduction

Game Automators is an open source organization that is dedicated to building tools and engage student and practitioner communities to share new and innovative ways of using computer and mobile games in a fashion that complement with the university education.

Making learning fun is extremely important and such learning could prove to be a major motivator for a lot more students to take up STEM courses and careers in technology. Access to quality education is still a distant reality for a large section of the population, however with the increase in smart phone penetration, learning content is now available at their fingertips in the form of MOOCs and other open course ware. However, theory and practice applied together have proven to deliver higher learning retention rate and increased interest in the area. The aim of Game Automators is to apply the content in courses of machine learning, computer vision, electronics etc.., to automate the game play in mobile and desktop games.

### Required Skills
- Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Other hardware skills.
- Ability to design and build custom PCBs with microcontrollers.
- Understanding of sensors and interplay with software applications.
- Prior IOT Application experience might be a huge plus.

# Game Automation Box

A very ambitious attempt for game automators is to build a universal game automation hardware box which integrates various sensors and motors to automatically plug and play with the android phone. These devices can prove to be great education aids and also have the potential to integrate other hardware sensors which could be used to play the required games. Playing very well with the framework, the framework can drive specific hardware motions (e.g. Tilt phone 30 degress left) which might be needed for a specific game action.

## Features of Box

1. Integration and coupling with the framework.
2. Hardware protoyping skills including off the shelf microprocessors/custom design of the hardware.
3. 3D Printing or hand crafting the box with wood.
4. Ability to integrate additional sensors and interface them easily with the software framework.
