## Organization: Game Automators

# Introduction

Game Automators is an open source organization that is dedicated to building tools and engage student and practitioner communities to share new and innovative ways of using computer and mobile games in a fashion that complement with the university education.

Making learning fun is extremely important and such learning could prove to be a major motivator for a lot more students to take up STEM courses and careers in technology. Access to quality education is still a distant reality for a large section of the population, however with the increase in smart phone penetration, learning content is now available at their fingertips in the form of MOOCs and other open course ware. However, theory and practice applied together have proven to deliver higher learning retention rate and increased interest in the area. The aim of Game Automators is to apply the content in courses of machine learning, computer vision, electronics etc.., to automate the game play in mobile and desktop games.

# iOS Automation Library

While `adb` is the open source command line tool for Android devices over which automation scripts could be built. iOS devices have `instruments` as the required command line library. However, there is no easy to use wrapper library which wraps all the functionality of `instruments` with ease for the end user. The aim of the project is to build the easy to use `iOS` device automation library which will blend itself into the game automation framework as described in one of the idea proposals.

### Required Skills
- iOS development and Systems engineering skills.
- Experience with Web / Desktop applications with Python/C++/Objective-C.
- Experience with test automation tools and frameworks.
- Understanding of CI Systems and Build pipelines.
- Proficiency with XCode and Apple developer tools along with access to a Mac for development.
