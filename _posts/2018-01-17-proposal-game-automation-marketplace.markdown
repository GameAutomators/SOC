## Organization: Game Automators

Game Automators is an open source organization that is dedicated to building tools and engage student and practitioner communities to share new and innovative ways of using computer and mobile games in a fashion that complement with the university education.

Making learning fun is extremely important and such learning could prove to be a major motivator for a lot more students to take up STEM courses and careers in technology. Access to quality education is still a distant reality for a large section of the population, however with the increase in smart phone penetration, learning content is now available at their fingertips in the form of MOOCs and other open course ware. However, theory and practice applied together have proven to deliver higher learning retention rate and increased interest in the area. The aim of Game Automators is to apply the content in courses of machine learning, computer vision, electronics etc.., to automate the game play in mobile and desktop games.
